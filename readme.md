# Billboard Hits + Data Munging

#### Project Summary
In this project I performed the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis on the Billboard Hits Data of 00's Musics, using Python packages like Pandas and Seaborn. 

2. I then tried coming with a problem statement -- Testing the normality of one key column 'weeks after peak'

3. Finally I brainstormed the techniques to check the normality of data
